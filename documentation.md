# Credit Card Recommendation Engine Documentation

## System Overview

The Credit Card Recommendation Engine is a web-based application designed to help users in India find the most suitable credit cards based on their personal preferences and financial profile. The system collects user information through a multi-step form, processes this information using a sophisticated recommendation algorithm, and presents personalized credit card recommendations with detailed information and match reasons.

## System Architecture

The system follows a client-server architecture with the following components:

1. **User Interface**: A responsive web interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that collects user preferences and displays recommendations.
2. **Backend Server**: A Flask application that handles API requests, processes user preferences, and returns recommendations.
3. **Recommendation Engine**: A Python module that implements the recommendation algorithm, filtering and scoring credit cards based on user preferences.
4. **Credit Card Database**: A collection of credit card information stored in JSON format, containing details about various credit cards from major Indian banks.

## Database Schema

The credit card database contains the following information for each card:

- **Basic Information**: card_id, card_name, issuer, card_type, card_tier
- **Fees and Charges**: joining_fee, annual_fee, renewal_fee, interest_rate, forex_markup, etc.

Each factor is assigned a weight, and the total score determines the ranking of the recommendations.
